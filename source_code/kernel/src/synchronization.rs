/// # UnsafeCell<T> from core lib
/// The core primitive for interior mutability in Rust.
///
/// If you have a reference &T, then normally in Rust the compiler performs optimizations based on 
/// the knowledge that &T points to immutable data. Mutating that data, for example through an alias 
/// or by transmuting an &T into an &mut T, is considered undefined behavior. UnsafeCell<T> opts-out 
/// of the immutability guarantee for &T: a shared reference &UnsafeCell<T> may point to data that is being mutated. 
/// This is called “interior mutability”.
///
/// The first entry into CoreCell<T> is used with "[X].into()">

/// ## Embedded mod

/// Any object implementing this trait guarantees exclusive access to the data wrapped within
/// the Mutex for the duration of the provided closure.

/// A pseudo-lock for teaching purposes.
///
/// In contrast to a real Mutex implementation, does not protect against 
/// concurrent access from other cores to the contained data.
///
/// The lock will only be used as long as it is safe to do so, i.e. as long as the kernel is
/// executing single-threaded, aka only running on a single core with interrupts disabled.
/// The "Sized" type is one in which the size (in RAM) is know at compile time
/// But "?Sized" is for unknown

///		to proceed while others must wait.
