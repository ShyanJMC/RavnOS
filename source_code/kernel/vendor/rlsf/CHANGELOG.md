## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.1] - 2023-02-17

### Fixed

- Bump `svgbobdoc` to `^0.3` to address a future-incompat report
  [rust-lang/rust#79813](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/79813)
- Don't enable the default features of
  [`const-default`](https://crates.io/crates/const-default/1.0.0) so that it

### Changed

- **Breaking:** Raised the minimum supported Rust version to 1.61

- `{Global,}Tlsf::new`
- `FlexTlsf::new` as a `const fn`
- `ConstDefault` implementation for `Tlsf`

### Removed

- **Breaking:** `{Global,}Tlsf::INIT`
- **Breaking:** `Init` (superseded by `ConstDefault` from [`const-default`](https://crates.io/crates/const-default/1.0.0))
